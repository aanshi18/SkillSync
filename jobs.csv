 FAQ
   

  

**Where does Watershed work?**
 We have hub offices in San Francisco, New York and London, and some remote team members in the US and EU. Most of our jobs need to be in San Francisco / New York / London, but certain jobs are open to being remote and will be specifically noted on the jobs page and in the job description.
   

  

**What’s the interview process like?**
 It starts the same for every candidate: getting to know the team members through 1 to 2 conversations about Watershed, your experience, and your interests. Next steps can vary by role, but usual next steps are a skill or experience screen (e.g. a coding interview for an engineer, a portfolio review for a designer, deeper experience call for other roles) which leads to a virtual or in person interview panel after that if the screens go well. We prioritize transparency and lack of surprise throughout the process.
   

  

**What if I need accommodations for my interview?**
 At Watershed, we are dedicated to ensuring an inclusive recruitment process. We provide reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities, long\\-term conditions, mental health needs, religious observances, neurodivergence, or pregnancy\\-related support requirements. If you need assistance during your process, please contact your recruiter.","Climate Data and Analytics","https://www.linkedin.com/company/watershedclimate","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQFQAitJ8Lkdhw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1670266114751/watershedclimate_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=U12drL_dDpLLIoaDusRYfx0ornJOozOLM2-VDQyvmoE","","","","","","","","","","",""

 Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Anthropic is looking for seasoned fullstack software engineers to join our core product teams and help build interfaces and APIs to interact with large language models. You will work with a team of talented engineers, product managers, designers, and researchers to design and implement key components of our current (ex. Claude.ai, our developer API) and future products and platform.
   

  

 We Have Multiple Teams That Are Currently Hiring. Team Placement Occurs After The Interview Process, Taking Into Account Your Interests And Experience Alongside Organizational Needs. This Flexible Approach Allows Us To Match Talented Engineers With The Platform Efforts Where They'll Have The Greatest Impact And Growth Potential
   

  

 The
 **API Developer Experience** 
 team is leading and defining the developer experience in the world of LLMs. Today, users struggle to get the most out of LLMs (e.g., navigating the cost\\-performance curve, etc). Put simply, it's easy to build a cool demo, but making a reliable and production\\-ready application is hard. As models become more intelligent and developers use models to perform more complex tasks (i.e. long\\-running agentic services), it'll be even harder for developers to understand what the model is capable of, how it’s performing, and how to observe it in multiple dimensions. Our team are building products and tools to enable developers to harness the full power of LLMs to create successful, reliable, and groundbreaking applications with ease.
   

  

 Our newly formed
 **Growth** 
 team is looking for engineers who will help drive user acquisition, engagement, and retention for Claude.ai through data\\-driven strategies and technical implementations. At Anthropic, we're not just building AI tools; we're reimagining how AI can enhance and expand its user base! As a founding member of the Growth team, you will have a unique opportunity to shape our growth strategy from the ground up. You will work with a cross\\-functional team of engineers, data scientists, marketers, and product managers to design, implement, and optimize growth initiatives that scale our AI\\-powered tools and maximize their impact.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Develop and implement technical solutions to support user acquisition, activation, retention, and revenue growth
* Craft an industry\\-defining developer experience for building AI applications
* Contribute to the development of AI\\-powered personalization and recommendation systems to enhance user engagement
* Develop conversational interfaces that leverage the language models
* Own and optimize end\\-to\\-end flow for using the Anthropic API, everything from onboarding to documentation to prompt engineering tools
* Design and execute A/B tests and experiments to optimize user onboarding, feature adoption, and overall product experience


**You Might Be a Good Fit If You**
* Have 7\\+ years of practical experience as a fullstack software engineer, ideally operating as a growth engineer, building APIs, or owning developer products/experiences
* Have demonstrated success in building high\\-adoption, well crafted consumer facing products
* Take a user\\-focused approach to development and care about solutions that are robust, scalable, and easy to use
* Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!)
* Thrive in a fast\\-paced, collaborative environment and enjoy working closely with cross\\-functional partners and teammates
* Are passionate about the potential of AI to reach and benefit a wide audience, and eager to tackle cutting\\-edge problems in AI safety and conversational AI


**Strong Candidates May Also**
* Have worked with NLP and ML models before and understand their capabilities and limitations
* Have built products from zero to one and/or operated in a startup environment
* Possess a vision for the future of AI product growth and a drive to make that vision a reality


**Annual Salary**

**Logistics**
**Education requirements:** 
 We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.
   

  

**Location\\-based hybrid policy:** 
 Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.
   

  

**Visa sponsorship:** 
 We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.
   

  

**We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.** 
 Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.
   

  

**How We're Different**
 We believe that the highest\\-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large\\-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long\\-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest\\-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.
   

  

 The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT\\-3, Circuit\\-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI \\& Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
